I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use.\\n\\nPlease go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale.\\n\\nIf you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the \"\"my contributions\"\" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting \"\"Image\"\" from the dropdown box. Note that any fair use images uploaded after 4 May, 2006, and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you. (talk • contribs • ) \\nUnspecified source for Image:Wonju.jpg\\n\\nThanks for uploading Image:Wonju.jpg. I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, then you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, then their copyright should also be acknowledged.\\n\\nAs well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media meets the criteria at Wikipedia:Fair use, use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair use. See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.\\n\\nIf you have uploaded other files, consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them, too. You can find a list of files you have uploaded by following [ this link]. Unsourced and untagged images may be deleted one week after they have been tagged, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, then you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, then their copyright should also be acknowledged.\\n\\nAs well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media meets the criteria at Wikipedia:Fair use, use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair use. See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.\\n\\nIf you have uploaded other files, consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them, too. You can find a list of files you have uploaded by following [ this link]. Unsourced and untagged images may be deleted one week after they have been tagged, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If the image is copyrighted under a non-free license (per Wikipedia:Fair use) then the image will be deleted 48 hours after . If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you. Do you want to opt out of receiving this notice?  hi! \"\n",
       "484       \"== TfD nomination of Template:SilentRedirect ==\\n\\nTemplate:SilentRedirect has been nominated for deletion. You are invited to comment on the discussion at Wikipedia:Templates for deletion#Template:SilentRedirect. Thank you.   | (talk) \\n\\n Watermarks \\n\\nI shall remove the obvious ones, the less obvious ones stay. I am allowed to watermark images with anything whatsoever I wish to, even if it's a contradiction, and if you wish me to use up further WP  bandwidth by re-uploading them, that has no effect on me. I can't do anything until this evening, and if any get deleted, I shall reupload them. Yours without respect (talk|email) \\nYou could have the grace to reply. I said that I'd deal with them this evening, but only the ones where the watermark is visible from the page. So *** off (talk|email) \\nI am planning to re-upload them with less obtrusive watermarks, such as that on Image:Bliss parody.jpg. (talk|email) \\nIt wasn't vandalism; I used an external link as per your instructions, which incidentally I'm not bound to follow. I am certainly on the verge of requesting mediation, as you are disrupting my life, never mind WP, to make a point. I will tell you one more time: any images are better than none. If you wish to get your own pix of all the concerned images, you're damn welcome to try, but they are GFDL therefore there's no grounds for removal. (talk|email) \\nPS - I shall add the external link again, not as an image, and if you remove it I shall make a formal complaint to the Wikimedia Foundation, and the Information Commissioner in London. (talk|email) \\n\\n, your conduct is a little off in this matter. While I'm all for discussing the issues with users, let's keep it civil please? Thanks.  (talk) \\n\\n I disagree, Rob - it is far more than \"\"a little\"\" off. Images watermarked as such are not in any way appropriate for Wikipedia. This is an encyclopædia, not a pet image project. If \"\"TheDoctor10\"\" isn't happy to play ball, he can go elsewhere.\\n  (talk) \\n\\nI am proposing a change to the image use policy to forbid watermarked images. Please voice an opinion at Wikipedia_talk:Image_use_policy#User-created_images -Thanks - talk \\n\\nI edit from the United Kingdom, and under the 1990 Computer Misuse Act, the editing of information online is illegal, without permission. The button at the top of every page that says \"\"Edit this page\"\", among other things, constitutes that permission, while the policies and guidelines form conditions. Since there is no condition against my image, it has a legal right to be there. Q.E.D. (talk|email) \\nTrue, but therefore your addition fails under the same logic. Also, Wikimedia own the servers, it's their right to delete it. 13ID:540053 \\nApologies to Ed for invading his talk page, but what a load of rubbish! Wikipedia are under no legal obligation whatsoever to host your images, regardless of whether they meet any policy. I have no idea under what flawed logic you presume that the fact you can edit Wikipedia means that your edits must legally be accepted. If the Computer Misuse Act states that the editing of information online is illegal without permission, that implies that editing with permission is legal, and nothing more. Furthermore, by your logic, I have the legal right to edit Wikipedia, and remove your images... I fail to see what on earth you intend to tell your lawyer, but I don't imagine the Wikimedia board are too concerned... └''''''/talk┐ \\n\\nIgnoring the gibberish i\n",

I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.\\n\\nPlease go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. \\n\\nIf you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the \"\"my contributions\"\" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting \"\"Image\"\" from the dropdown box.

I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, then you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, then their copyright should also be acknowledged.\\n\\nAs well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media meets the criteria at Wikipedia:Fair use, use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair use. See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.\\n\\nIf you have uploaded other files, consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them, too. You can find a list of files you have uploaded by following [ this link]. Unsourced and untagged images may be deleted one week after they have been tagged, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If the image is copyrighted under a non-free license (per Wikipedia:Fair use) then the image will be deleted 48 hours after . If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you.  (Contr)\n",

I noticed the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:\\n\\n Go to the image description page and edit it to add , without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template.\\n On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself.\\n\\nIf you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on [ this link].

This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.\\n\\nIf you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or \"\"db\"\" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.\\n\\nFor guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies.

       "155909    \"\\n\\nShiotani Teiko. And dozens and dozens more just like it.\\n\\nHi. You created an article saying, in full: Shiotani Teiko (塩谷定好? しおたに ていこう, 1899 - 1988) was a renowned Japanese photographer.\\n\\nActually it's Teikō, not Teiko, and according to WP's silly rules we have to ignore his real name of Shiotani Teikō and instead call him Teikō Shiotani. But that's not the main problem, which is that he's described in just about the same way as Kuribayashi Satoshi (栗林慧? くりばやし さとし, born 1939) is a renowned Japanese photographer. Or indeed Watanabe Kanendo (渡辺兼人? わたなべ かねんど, born 1947) is a renowned Japanese photographer. Or Orihara Kei (折原恵? おりはら けい, born 1948) is a renowned Japanese photographer. And so on and so on and so on. Which all means that somebody looking among Category:Japanese photographers is highly likely to land on a mere substub.\\n\\nI can count on my fingers the people likely to turn a half dozen or so of these substubs into articles. No, on my thumbs: User:Pinkville and myself. But he's busy and I am too. I'd rate the probability that more than half will be converted within a year to more than stubs at well under 1%. It's an interesting \"\"proof of bot concept\"\" exercise, but is it good for anything else? \\n\\nTell you what: I'll match you one for one. You turn two of these into articles; I'll turn two into articles. You turn ten into articles; I'll turn ten into articles. How does that sound?   \\n\\nThat's a great challenge! You're on. –  (talk) (random) \\n\\nOK then. Do tell me when you've done one, as I can't keep the whole damn lot on my watchlist. Well actually I can, but I lack the time and effort to put them onto my watchlist. Also, I'll be intercoursingly busy during the next month, so in the short/medium term I may only be able to match you up to ten.\\n\\nI'm sure I've got entire books by at least twenty of these substubbed people, so I ought to be able to do more.\\n\\nWhat's odd about the list are some conspicuous absences. (Not just people I think are good, but people who, rightly or wrongly, are celebrated and successful.) Asai Shinpei is one, and there are more though I can't think of them right now. \\n\\nNot that it's any of my business, really, but did you scarf the list from User:20th Century Art (Zenhan)'s page, or do something else?   \\n\\nYeah, I scraped from Zenhan. I'll let you know here, or on your talk page, when I have one ready. I don't think I can make any of them featured, but legitimately \"\"non-stub\"\" is the goal. All the best, –  (talk) (random) \\n\\nOkay, here's my first. Ichiki Shiro. It's not much beyond a stub, but it's something. (It took an hour of research, and I think I found all the info that's anywhere on the web regarding Mr. Ichiki.) By the way, was I right in listing him as a Hatamoto? My sources say he was a retainer of the Daimyo (in the Edo period, of course), and I know that he spoke with his Daimyo, so he couldn't have been a Gokenin. But I don't think he was a warrior, so I don't know. So far as I can tell, all Togugawa retainers were either Gokenin or Hatamoto. Am I correct in my inference? –  (talk) (random) \\n\\nDamn you're fast. \\n\\nUnfortunately I don't know squat about Tokugawa retainers and the like. On several occasions I've tried to interest myself in feudal history but have always fallen flat. I suppose I can't separate it from the hammily acted, cheesily lit TV period dramas I sometimes have to tolerate when at the in-laws'. LordAmeth might know. (And this photographer's right up Pinkville's street.)   \\n\\nHow's this for a progress indicator?   \\nGreat! –  (talk) (random) \\nYup, except for a number of factors, one of which is that it's problematical copyrightwise (or so I infer from a comment elsewhere by one User:Quadell). I've already chucked in one extra list, and I'll certainly add one more, and I may add one after that; perhaps it can then be described as an original creation. All this is delaying my editing of any article. Still, I'll get around to that too in time.   \\nI hope that I've no\n",

Whichever president came before Hafez (i just new he was president before assad) has considerable foreground of support, in which his supports would have freaked out because of the coup. They would have claimed instability would arise, as assad's supporters are trying to use in their defense. \\n\\nWhat i am trying to say is that although Bashar assad had good economic and international policies for Syria, you should not fear a non-baathist potentially being elected.  Syria's economic and international policies won't change (iran would still be a major factor in Syrian life considering the buisness deals stakes and cultural exchanges) , the only this that would change are social freedoms, and for the better. Also every country had a revolution and they are still alive today. The Muslim brotherhood in Syria is weak, even weaker than the islamist prescence in Libya. The rebels in Libya had 80-90% support, as we see now, and yet could hardly take control without NATO. What chance does the Syrian Muslim brotherhood have? None. If anything, nonviolent protests weaken the resolve of the Muslim brotherhood, making them less of an influence in the everyday life of Syrians. As you know I am pro Syria and Armenia, just not pro Assad. Unlike Armenia where people like Sargsyan and Kopcharyan were democratically elected, Assad was not (no one ran against him because they were not allowed).</td>\n",

Therefore if one insists on deleting this particular article then go ahead as it seems to me there is no room for democratic thinking on your website whatsoever. I’d like to add a few more words as my final statement. Wikipedia says:  “Sources may encompass published works in all forms and media, and in any language. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability. The art works and art life of the artist is the sourcefor academic press, Ukrainian media, academic institutions, as well as poets, writers and publications use his paintings &amp; drawings to illustrate books. The artist takes a part in a busy art life in the Ukraine presenting a number of exhibitions &amp; art projects. Having said that I see that there is no enough evidence for one????? \\nTABBodnar O./Боднар О. — Л.

What is the difference between the article about Alexander Voytovych and, for example, the Herb Roe’s article, why the mentioned article is considered more accurate? I must highlight once again that instead of explaining what has to be changed or corrected on the page, one awards us with thenoticeboards. Regarding self-promotion  which was mentioned a few times I’d like to make it clear  the artists is a Ukrainian and naturally all sources are Ukrainian, and if the mentioned language is unknown to one it doesn’t meant that it allows one doubts the genuine sources. The Ukrainian and Russian versions of Wikipedia have accepted the article and honoured it, which says a lot.I had in my mind to present more Ukrainian artist, however having such an experience; I’d rather leave this business behind thanks to you. Thanks for co-operation. From my point of view this discussion is exceeded, feel free to delete the article!\\n  \"</td>\n",

To you, it's all cold hard data, with stupidty thrown in for free. Your level of intelligence sickens me. You've also failed to note the case for central pressure, which was on par with most Cat 5 storms. What you're proposing is this: \\n\\n\"\"A cyclone that brought about more than the effects and damages of a typical Category 4 storm and that had the Central Pressure of a typical Category 5 storm, is in fact a mere Category 3, simply because it's confirmed/measured sustained winds were 5 knots below the \"\"cut-off\"\" for Category 4.\"\"\\n\\nFor the rest of you: SS scale uses 1-minute averages.

At the very top it states:\\n\\n\"\"It is also used to categorize a number of diverse populations together based on historical and prehistorical ancestral relationships. Some definitions of the term include only people of relatively recent Sub Saharan African descent (see African diaspora). Among the members of this group, dark skin is most often accompanied by the expression of natural afro-hair texture (although a recent scientific study notes that human skin color diversity is highest in sub-Saharan African populations). Other definitions of the term \"\"black people\"\" extend to other populations characterized by dark skin, including some indigenous to Oceania and Southeast Asia\"\"\\n\\nThis article even mentions Oceanians and Southeast Asians (such as the Great Andamanese, Native Fijians, the Ati,  and the Melanesians) even though these groups genetically have more in common with neighboring Asian populations and are very distant from other people who are considered Black Africans. Ethiopians are black Africans. Some of them have Middle-Eastern ancestry (Ethiopia is a short boat ride from Arabia), but that automatically does not make them an entirely mixed population; nor does it change the fact that their roots are mainly in Africa. Sicilians have some Middle-Eastern ancestry, but they are still considered European. Ancient Romans certainly referred to Ethiopians as black. They used the term \"\"Ethiopian\"\" to describe all Black Africans they came across, regardless of their location outside of East Africa (read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_expeditions_to_Sub-Saharan_Africa)\\n\\nI went to the Beta Israel page and found two very clear references: \\n\\nEphraim Isaac (1974), The Falasha: Black Jews of Ethiopia.

If she [a patient] keeps taking an injection every three months, she is not going to have children – you know it is a 100 per cent secure from children I think.”\\n\\nHedva says the policy is working – the number of black babies in Israel is decreasing, but there are no official statistics to back up her claim. For community workers and Ethiopian women here, statistics are unnecessary – they feel their reality speaks for itself.\\n\\nThe Health Ministry admits it issues the drug, but says it was never its policy only to administer it to Ethiopian women and reduce the number of black babies in the country.\"\"\\n\\nI would say that makes Ethiopian Jew's a valid part of this article.\\n\\n(Click Here to leave a message)\"</td>\n",

It has nothing to do with Sheba, however, as that happened (if it even did) ca.1000-950 BC, not AD. The first one is rather odd because it's written by the same person who wrote Aksum.

Neither does Mr Baxter being a Catholic.  I doubt he knocked on the doors of catholic homes and goaded them to EFC.  Most people would not have heard of him.  The EFC committee was predominately Liberal and Houlding Tory being councillor.  Many of the EFC committee were in temperance societies, Houlding was a brewer and they viewed he wanted to sell his ales at Anfield - he wanted sole refreshments rights.  Houlding insisted the teams changed at his Sandon pub and walk to the ground.  Holding made money from this in sales. \\n\\nThe split at EFC creating Liverpool was purely principles.  No religion at all.  Everton wanted a community based club with a spread of shares. Houlding wanted a few rich owners holding most of the shares - the corporate model which is still the same today.  Everton on going to Goodison Park issued 5,000 shares for the fans. EFC were the first to have a shareholders association and the meets are always in the Liverpool Echo.  Everton put the profits back into the club for the benefit of the fans, and by the 1930s had 4 double-decked stands, while Anfield was primitive in comparison because the owners creamed off - despite both clubs having about the same sized fanbase.  Anfield was only uprated in 1963 with the Kemlyn Rd stand, the rest being 1906 at the latest - two years later EFC were hosting a world cup semi-final, the difference was so marked.\\n\\nFrom Leeds university study. Link on the history site. Stored at Cambridge university.\\n\\nLeeds University Study:-\\n\\nBoth of the city’s major clubs share a common origin. An Everton football club was established as a small chapel team in 1878, it became a founder member of the Football League in 1888, first won the championship in 1890-91, and at that time played its home matches at Anfield. By the early 1890s, however, the club was in serious difficulties, experiencing a traumatic internal schism that tore through its management and ownership and led to the creation of a second club.\\n\\nThe club’s main financial backer was Houlding, a prominent brewer and Tory politician but, amidst allegations of financial exploitation, in 1892 the majority of the club’s members abandoned the Anfield site, removed the club from Houlding’s control and set out for Goodison – in retaliation, Houlding incorporated a new club, Liverpool F.C, based at Anfield.\\n\\nThe story of the schism provides an important illustration of how far a successful professional football organization had become integrated into community identity and politics by the late Victorian period. In an early manifestation of today’s frictions between commercial backers and fans, the research shows that the intensity of the wrangling over the governance and ownership of the club bore witness to the importance, even at that early date, of perceptions of the club as a worthy political prize, as a means by which wealthy individuals could gain influence and prestige.\\n\\nThe historical dispute at Everton also emphasises significant contemporary perceptions of the role an iconic football club could play in moulding social behaviour. The owners and directors of the new Everton F.C. believed such an important social institution could be a bastion of ‘purity’, a model of Christian sobriety, of Nonconformist, Liberal ideals. In governance terms they sought to carry over the original ideal of a more democratic ‘members’ club’ into the era of incorporation.\\n\\nHoulding, too, was well aware of the importance of a successful football club for community identity and involvement, but he believed a corporate structure based on a ‘modern’ business model (wherein investors had control and could expect a reasonable rate of return) was more appropriate. His behaviour at Everton F.C., and his subsequent success in establishing Liverpool F.C., reveal his attempts to weld together politics and sport in such a way as to wield influence in both, to help secure the support base for his brand of ‘Tory Democracy’.\\n\\nHowever, the difficulties he encountered at Everton F.C. also show the strength of opposing political perceptions. The alternative Liberal vision of the sober artisan football supporter, closely involved in the affairs of his club through membership and diverse shareholdings, and wary of autocratic manipulations from the drinks trade, proved capable of wrenching Everton F.C. from Houlding’s control even if, after only a short time, he was able to establish a successful rival club.\\n\\nAnother feature of the schism was that it occurred within Protestant ranks for, despite the prominence often assigned to the role of sectarianism in Liverpool politics – and despite the political importance of Irish Home</td>\n",

       "      <td>Nephilim deleted edit \\n\\nYou state reliable sources. The first part of my edit is that which is taught in college (you would know if you ever attended). It is taught in literature class. It is: When studying this passage, or any passage of the Bible, it is best to use the Exegetical method, which is tearing it down to the bottom and rebuilding it using 6 contexts. First, one must use the Bible to interpret the Bible. Second, using the 6 contexts, which are: 1. What is the context (main idea, or thought) of the Bible?, 2. What is the context of the book you are reading (Genesis, Exodus, etc.)?, 3. What is the context of the chapter you are reading?, 4. What is the context of the verse you are reading? 5. What is the context of the key words?, and 6. What is the historical context? How did the people of that time think, act, etc. An example, to name something is to place one's authority on it. A king of a city state that has conquered another city state gives it a new name, because he is place his authority on it. Two things to keep in mind for a sound, correct interpretation of this passage are: 1. Where is the beginning of the narrative; the pivotal spot? It is Genesis 3:15, which is a prophecy of Christ and the beginning of the battle between evil and good. It is followed by the first example the story of Cain and Abel., 2. In the original Bible there were no chapter or verses, these were added later to make it easier to find passages. The story of the Flood begins at Genesis 4:17 and goes to Genesis 9:7 (this story should have been 1 chapter).\\nThis aids the scholar attempting to understand and interpret a difficult passage. \\nThe next part: Wilson's Old Testament Word Studies, William Wilson (MacDonald Publishing Co. ISBN 0-917006-27-5, New Wilson's Old Testament Word Studies, William Wilson; Kregel Publications 1987, ISBN 0-8254-4030-0/ both page 185)renders the word nephilim meaning as to fall upon other in rapine violence and apostates fallen from true religion. Strong's Exhaustive Concordance Of The Bible Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary, James Strong (MacDonald Publishing Co. ISBN 0-917006-01-1) cites the word as a bully,tyrant, or dictator. \\nHere is given references to where the data is gotten (even page numbers), but by what you say this is reliable or acceptable. Just what would be.\\nThe next part: One can get copies of the First and Second Book of Enoch, which one can read. Two such books are The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, Vol 1(Doubleday &amp; Co. Inc., 1983 ISBN 0-385-09630-5)and The Other Bible(Harper &amp; Row, Publishers ISBN 0-06-250031-7)and there others. A WARNING. When reading these books keep in mind that they are non-canonical and are considered fictional; not God inspired and truthful. When one reads the Book of Enoch one sees a measurement for the offspring as 300 cubits. A cubit is 18 inches (check any Bible dictionary), or 1 1/2 feet. As such the offspring is 450 feet tall.\\nThis again shows where one can find the data. All these references are from PUBLISHED and ESTABLISHED books, that is accepted by college professors, but not by you. How did the article get on Wikipedia? Did the author bribe someone, or is it that they are a dear buddy?\\nYou may think this harsh, and it may be, but it is deserved. The reason why the information has been verified with published authentic sources that you refuse to accept. Then what needs to take place is that the articles references must be rejected as well for they are based on the same method and material. Why accept one person's references and not an others when both are from published established sources available to the public.\\nOnce before I attempted this folly on an other article and again nothing, not even a police report, was accepted. The only thing I can think for this is that Wikipedia employees are not getting their palm greased, or that I am not a dear buddy with an in.\\nThe reliable verified referenced attainable data is beneficial and helpful to the reader and scholar, but you and Wikipedia don't care, and spit on me, my effort to help, and the ones who would have benefited from it. Now you cam laugh and do a dance for you wasted my time and you have robbed the reader.</td>\n",

I'm not looking for full edit-filter rights, but I would like to help develop the appropriate filter. If you don't have the time to deal with this right now let me know, and I'll engage someone else.\\n\\nI am new to the syntax, but here's my general format right now:\\n\\n(user_editcount &lt; 50) &amp; (article_namespace == 0) &amp; (lcase(added_lines) rlike \"\"dateofbirth *=+|birth ?da(te|y)|\\(born |\\(b\\. \"\") &amp; (lcase(added_lines) rlike \"\"\"\") &amp; (lcase(removed_lines) rlike \"\"\"\")\\n\\nWhere I have  is the birthday searching regex I've been working on. Below is what I've developed so far. I haven't tested it extensively, but I've thrown it against a few BLPs and it works fairly well. It finds the usual ways that birthdays are presented, either in template, or in lead, for example (b. January 1, 2010).\\n\\nHere's the regex\\n(date of birth *=+|b\\.[^&amp;-]+(&amp;.dash;|-+)|\\( *born |birth ?da(te|y) *=+|\\() *(([0-3]?[0-9],?)? *(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\\.?[^0-9\\.]*([0123]?[0-9],? *)[12][0-9]{3})|(\\{\\{birth[^\\}]+\\}\\}).*$\\n\\nI don't know how to check for what specifically was edited, as in if a numerical value was changed. Is Edit Filter able to do this sort of thing? I welcome any other ideas you have. I assume this will require more work. But please let me know how to push this along.\\n\\n  \"</td>\n",

If another one of you reverts my edits I will dissociate myself from WikiProject Tropical Cyclones indefinitely. \\nHere's my comparative table for all of you to have a nice, long look at ). If you ignore this reasoning, I'll just have to call you names:\\n\\n Characteristic Saffir-Simpson Cat 4 Cyclone Larry Central pressure 920-944 mbar 915! mbar when landfall made Potential damages \"\"More extensive curtainwall failures with some complete roof structure failure on small residences. Major erosion of beach areas. Terrain may be flooded well inland.\"\" 55% of all buildings in Innisfail damaged. Entire banana crop and some of sugarcane crop demolished. Rooves stripped of countless buildings; some buildings flattened entirely. Extensive flooding. Universal power outages, sewage system fails. Airports closed for the day.

In the 1980-90's, a lot of True Aviation historians (i.e. Roger Freeman, Jeff Ethell, Warbirds Worldwide, etc..) found that aviation historians wanted and needed history recorded.  The captions of their books detailed who, what, when, where, etc...  As we progressed into the 2000's, I am finding that today’s writers unfortunately, want to dumb down the article - instead of giving all the details to allow the readers to decide how much level of detail he wants - Again, unfortunately, BillCJ (as well as others) want to take the Dick &amp; Jane approach to aviation history.\\n\\nThis is suppose to be an online reference/encyclopedia - often when you Google an item, the wiki article is the first reference to pop-up so this will be (unfortunately) the first and only reference many will have for a subject.  A subject has to include everyone that references and item, whether it be a 4 year old doing his first model airplane, the aviation historian, the F-16 Buff.  These articles are also used by serious models who want the details.\\n\\nArticles only tell part of the story - you need the pictures to compliment and point out what the article is discussing.  In the same vein, the pictures need the same level of detailed study (if possible) and care that is place in creating the entire article.  Having a great and fantastic article (such as the F-16) with kindergarten captions makes the entire article pointless.\\n\\nIt is also unfortunate that other editors like Askari Mark feels that detailed captions are meaningless to most readers - again, you can not have an online reference/encyclopedia without filling crossing the t and doting the i's.  Without detailed captions, it like having no reference section - sure you can print captions that state \"\" Gee an F-16 in Flight \"\" - especially when it is clear that the airplane is sitting on the ground.  Or the case of one article \"\"Aircraft is on a bomb-run\"\" when it was clear from the picture that the bomb-bay doors were closed, no guns in the waist position and the detailed history showed the aircraft actually was a trainer and never left the United State...\\n\\nBillCJ also mentioned \"\" are you seriously suggesting that \"\" serious historians \"\" only read WP articles for the pictures? \"\" - it is a proven fact that 90% of all information processed by humans come from Visual\"\" data (i.e. pictures, etc...) - this is the reason Picture books are popular with preschoolers.  The first thing a majority humans look out when reading any thing is the pictures - if the pictures are interesting then many people will stop and read.  If an aviation historian comes across an article that details the subject matter then he will stop and read the contents.\\n\\nIt is also been said that this article is not for the F-16 Buffs - if this is the case, then \\n why have technical specifications\\n why have details on each variation??  \\n Why have the nuts and bolts of each individual user??\\n Etc, Etc, Etc...\\nWhy have detailed information regarding anything regarding the aircraft if this subject is not going to reach out to those who can say yes, this is true (i.e. the historian/buff) - If you are going to have the nuts and bolts in the article then you have to carry this same thought patterns over to have the nuts and bolts details in the photo captions.... (for example: B-52 Specifications, B-52 Costs, B-52 Variants) etc...  this type of informations IS for the Aviation Historian / Buff and generally not for the casual reader (which is MY point in having detailed captions).\\n\\nIf we dumbdown the photocaptions for the \"\"causual reader, then this level of details Specifications, costs, variations also needs to be removed as it will only confuse the \"\" casual reader \"\" and will lead to people calling all such information \"\" gobbledy-gook \"\".\\n\\nIf we dumbdown the photocaptions or call detailed information \"\" gobbledy-gook to most readers \"\" then terms such as: Wing area, Airfoil, Zero-lift drag coefficient, Drag area, Aspect ratio, Maximum speed:, Combat radius:, Ferry range, Service ceiling ,Rate of climb, Wing loading, Thrust/weight, Lift-to-drag ratio are \"\"gobbledy-gook to most non-aviation readers\"\"\\n\\nBillCJ has also mentioned that Wiki is not the place for F-16 Buff's to write article - This is complete opposite what the founders of wiki wanted when this project (wikipedia as a whole) dreamed many, many years ago - Wiki w</td>\n",

It is the largest sect in Pakistan. Even the outdated CIA fact book can verify this. It seems that alJazera does not know what they are talking about. If anyone have a doubt about the connection between Barelvis and sufis, then simply read an article about Barelvis(which is insufficient and at parts incorrect - like many other articles here). They are sufis or they have a sufi master to whom they belong(speaking on the individual level). Personally I can tell you that for a Barelvi, sufis are considered our elderly; our wise sages who we seek for enlightenment and religious knowledge. Barelvi == Sufi more or less(to simplify things for the reader). People need to stop selling their propaganda and belittling the sufis. Barelvis usually call themselves ahle sunnah wal'jamat(this would be the international representative name barelvis refer themselves as - unlike in Pakistan and India due to complexities arising due to impostors). This is the largest sect in the Islamic world(no quotation - simply based on experience and personal research); where sufis are considered as mentioned, our elderly, our sages, our spiritual guides. Hence sufi's are not some sect, but simply our respectable elderly. The sect is called Ahle Sunnah wal'Jamat. An ok translation would be \"\"The people of the Sunnah\"\". Unlike Christianity, the right to claim of the true sect is of utmost importance for muslims due to Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad s.a.w mentioning of the divide among us and that only one sect would be the truly guided one - which shall happen to be the largest one(from the hadith). Again seek out the source if you are interested. Its in the major Hadith collections. Hence quantity is an important question when it comes to pinpointing any discrepancy in this regard. Strictly speaking from an encyclopedic perspective, how can it be considered acceptable to disregard quantity ? If anyone doubts that most Pakistanis are sufis/barelvis/ahle sunnat wal'jamat. Then simply take a look at Sindh. I don't have the exact number, but its like 90-95 % sufis. Its only in NWFP that the majority are Wahabis. But that corresponds to ca. less than 10%(there are shia as well in NWFP and some other sects) of the total population in Pakistan(census 2010). How difficult is it for people to at least conduct their own research and try to separate truth from fallacy ?\"</td>\n",

Whichever president came before Hafez (i just new he was president before assad) has considerable foreground of support, in which his supports would have freaked out because of the coup. They would have claimed instability would arise, as assad's supporters are trying to use in their defense. \\n\\nWhat i am trying to say is that although Bashar assad had good economic and international policies for Syria, you should not fear a non-baathist potentially being elected.  Syria's economic and international policies won't change (iran would still be a major factor in Syrian life considering the buisness deals stakes and cultural exchanges) , the only this that would change are social freedoms, and for the better. Also every country had a revolution and they are still alive today. The Muslim brotherhood in Syria is weak, even weaker than the islamist prescence in Libya. The rebels in Libya had 80-90% support, as we see now, and yet could hardly take control without NATO. What chance does the Syrian Muslim brotherhood have? None. If anything, nonviolent protests weaken the resolve of the Muslim brotherhood, making them less of an influence in the everyday life of Syrians. As you know I am pro Syria and Armenia, just not pro Assad. Unlike Armenia where people like Sargsyan and Kopcharyan were democratically elected, Assad was not (no one ran against him because they were not allowed).   \n",

From this I understand, that name Česko-Slovensko was oficial name 1990-92 only in  Slovak/ia, but it was oficial name of whole Czechoslovakia.

Therefore if one insists on deleting this particular article then go ahead as it seems to me there is no room for democratic thinking on your website whatsoever. I’d like to add a few more words as my final statement. Wikipedia says:  “Sources may encompass published works in all forms and media, and in any language. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability. The art works and art life of the artist is the sourcefor academic press, Ukrainian media, academic institutions, as well as poets, writers and publications use his paintings & drawings to illustrate books. The artist takes a part in a busy art life in the Ukraine presenting a number of exhibitions & art projects. Having said that I see that there is no enough evidence for one????? \\nTABBodnar O./Боднар О. — Л.

What is the difference between the article about Alexander Voytovych and, for example, the Herb Roe’s article, why the mentioned article is considered more accurate? I must highlight once again that instead of explaining what has to be changed or corrected on the page, one awards us with thenoticeboards. Regarding self-promotion  which was mentioned a few times I’d like to make it clear  the artists is a Ukrainian and naturally all sources are Ukrainian, and if the mentioned language is unknown to one it doesn’t meant that it allows one doubts the genuine sources. The Ukrainian and Russian versions of Wikipedia have accepted the article and honoured it, which says a lot.I had in my mind to present more Ukrainian artist, however having such an experience; I’d rather leave this business behind thanks to you.

Not only did Harald not fit the classic image physically, he was a rather unusual Viking. \\n\\nThat is, if your understanding was that the life of a Viking was all battles and pillage. The good King Harald brought Christianity to Scandinavia and also \"\"united\"\" Denmark and Norway. And while we are destroying long-held beliefs, Vikings did not have horns on their helmets! \\n\\nMuch of Harald’s history was learnt from two runic stones erected to his memory in the town of Jelling in Denmark.\"   \n",

Conclusion Larry is indeed a category 4 cyclone at the very least, unless we are willing to ignore important factors for the sake of 10km/h of confirmed sustained wind.\\n\\nI already have an article (American) claiming it was Cat 4. It's right [here. However, as you stated earlier, newsgroups are not an authority on the matter, are they? As for my friend , well what can I say to you? You have gone against all sound logic and called me a liar because I can't confirm 10km/h of sustained wind. I'm unsure if you even know what logic is. To you, it's all cold hard data, with stupidty thrown in for free. Your level of intelligence sickens me. You've also failed to note the case for central pressure, which was on par with most Cat 5 storms. What you're proposing is this: \\n\\n\"\"A cyclone that brought about more than the effects and damages of a typical Category 4 storm and that had the Central Pressure of a typical Category 5 storm, is in fact a mere Category 3, simply because it's confirmed/measured sustained winds were 5 knots below the \"\"cut-off\"\" for Category 4.\"\"\\n\\nFor the rest of you: SS scale uses 1-minute averages. A 1-minute average of 200km/h was RECORDED about 30km north of where the cyclone crossed. I understand this is 10km/h less than the cut off for cat 4 (as stated above), but at least it puts estimates and what-nt to rest. Further, I'll leave the rest of my argument to logic, that is, if you have any.\\n\\nListen to me very carefully. Beauty may fade, but dumb is forever.  \"   \n",

At the very top it states:\\n\\n\"\"It is also used to categorize a number of diverse populations together based on historical and prehistorical ancestral relationships. Some definitions of the term include only people of relatively recent Sub Saharan African descent (see African diaspora). Among the members of this group, dark skin is most often accompanied by the expression of natural afro-hair texture (although a recent scientific study notes that human skin color diversity is highest in sub-Saharan African populations). Other definitions of the term \"\"black people\"\" extend to other populations characterized by dark skin, including some indigenous to Oceania and Southeast Asia\"\"\\n\\nThis article even mentions Oceanians and Southeast Asians (such as the Great Andamanese, Native Fijians, the Ati,  and the Melanesians) even though these groups genetically have more in common with neighboring Asian populations and are very distant from other people who are considered Black Africans. Ethiopians are black Africans. Some of them have Middle-Eastern ancestry (Ethiopia is a short boat ride from Arabia), but that automatically does not make them an entirely mixed population; nor does it change the fact that their roots are mainly in Africa. Sicilians have some Middle-Eastern ancestry, but they are still considered European. Ancient Romans certainly referred to Ethiopians as black. They used the term \"\"Ethiopian\"\" to describe all Black Africans they came across, regardless of their location outside of East Africa (read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_expeditions_to_Sub-Saharan_Africa)\\n\\nI went to the Beta Israel page and found two very clear references: \\n\\nEphraim Isaac (1974), The Falasha: Black Jews of Ethiopia. Dillard University Scholar Statesman Lecture Series.\\n\\nSimon D. Messing (1982). The Story of the Falashas \"\"Black Jews of Ethiopia\"\". Brooklyn. ISBN 0-9615946-9-1\\n\\nHere's more from another article (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_Israel#Black_Hebrew_Israelite_immigration)\\n\\nRebhun, Uzi, Jews in Israel: contemporary social and cultural patterns\\n\\n\"\"The Israeli government has airlifted black Ethiopian Jews to Israel and given them citizenship in the same way it has been a haven to Jews oppressed throughout the Middle East and Africa\"\"\\n\\n\"\"She told RT: “They don't want poor or black children and Depo-Provera gave them the opportunity to have control. If she [a patient] keeps taking an injection every three months, she is not going to have children – you know it is a 100 per cent secure from children I think.”\\n\\nHedva says the policy is working – the number of black babies in Israel is decreasing, but there are no official statistics to back up her claim. For community workers and Ethiopian women here, statistics are unnecessary – they feel their reality speaks for itself.\\n\\nThe Health Ministry admits it issues the drug, but says it was never its policy only to administer it to Ethiopian women and reduce the number of black babies in the country.\"\"\\n\\nI would say that makes Ethiopian Jew's a valid part of this article.\\n\\n(Click Here to leave a message)\"   \n",

Ethiopian civilization starting in 500 AD? Maybe they meant BC, but still, Ethiopian civilization is older than that. Good job on finding the link by Negash, I've seen it before and it's informative on the post-Aksumite and Zagwe period. It has nothing to do with Sheba, however, as that happened (if it even did) ca.1000-950 BC, not AD. The first one is rather odd because it's written by the same person who wrote Aksum. I can't really comment on it, but no one has ever said that D`mt was founded by Sabaeans, as it predates the Sabaean migration by a few centuries. I'm not sure why he assumes that all of the 500 BC inscriptions in Sabaean (does he mean script or language?) were made by Sabaeans either, since Ethiopians used the same script... May I ask what you are trying to demonstrate with those links? —  (Yom) | contribs • Talk • E \"   \n",
       "28199   This is total tripe!!  A bunch of brainwaahed, Glasweigian, nutters running down Goodison Rd does not prove a Catholic bias at EFC. Or, some loons in the Kop on a derby day.   Neither does Mr Baxter being a Catholic.  I doubt he knocked on the doors of catholic homes and goaded them to EFC.  Most people would not have heard of him.  The EFC committee was predominately Liberal and Houlding Tory being councillor.  Many of the EFC committee were in temperance societies, Houlding was a brewer and they viewed he wanted to sell his ales at Anfield - he wanted sole refreshments rights.  Houlding insisted the teams changed at his Sandon pub and walk to the ground.  Holding made money from this in sales. \\n\\nThe split at EFC creating Liverpool was purely principles.  No religion at all.  Everton wanted a community based club with a spread of shares. Houlding wanted a few rich owners holding most of the shares - the corporate model which is still the same today.  Everton on going to Goodison Park issued 5,000 shares for the fans. EFC were the first to have a shareholders association and the meets are always in the Liverpool Echo.  Everton put the profits back into the club for the benefit of the fans, and by the 1930s had 4 double-decked stands, while Anfield was primitive in comparison because the owners creamed off - despite both clubs having about the same sized fanbase.  Anfield was only uprated in 1963 with the Kemlyn Rd stand, the rest being 1906 at the latest - two years later EFC were hosting a world cup semi-final, the difference was so marked.\\n\\nFrom Leeds university study. Link on the history site. Stored at Cambridge university.\\n\\nLeeds University Study:-\\n\\nBoth of the city’s major clubs share a common origin. An Everton football club was established as a small chapel team in 1878, it became a founder member of the Football League in 1888, first won the championship in 1890-91, and at that time played its home matches at Anfield. By the early 1890s, however, the club was in serious difficulties, experiencing a traumatic internal schism that tore through its management and ownership and led to the creation of a second club.\\n\\nThe club’s main financial backer was Houlding, a prominent brewer and Tory politician but, amidst allegations of financial exploitation, in 1892 the majority of the club’s members abandoned the Anfield site, removed the club from Houlding’s control and set out for Goodison – in retaliation, Houlding incorporated a new club, Liverpool F.C, based at Anfield.\\n\\nThe story of the schism provides an important illustration of how far a successful professional football organization had become integrated into community identity and politics by the late Victorian period. In an early manifestation of today’s frictions between commercial backers and fans, the research shows that the intensity of the wrangling over the governance and ownership of the club bore witness to the importance, even at that early date, of perceptions of the club as a worthy political prize, as a means by which wealthy individuals could gain influence and prestige.\\n\\nThe historical dispute at Everton also emphasises significant contemporary perceptions of the role an iconic football club could play in moulding social behaviour. The owners and directors of the new Everton F.C. believed such an important social institution could be a bastion of ‘purity’, a model of Christian sobriety, of Nonconformist, Liberal ideals. In governance terms they sought to carry over the original ideal of a more democratic ‘members’ club’ into the era of incorporation.\\n\\nHoulding, too, was well aware of the importance of a successful football club for community identity and involvement, but he believed a corporate structure based on a ‘modern’ business model (wherein investors had control and could expect a reasonable rate of return) was more appropriate. His behaviour at Everton F.C., and his subsequent success in establishing Liverpool F.C., reveal his attempts to weld together politics and sport in such a way as to wield influence in both, to help secure the support base for his brand of ‘Tory Democracy’.\\n\\nHowever, the difficulties he encountered at Everton F.C. also show the strength of opposing political perceptions. The alternative Liberal vision of the sober artisan football supporter, closely involved in the affairs of his club through membership and diverse shareholdings, and wary of autocratic manipulations from the drinks trade, proved capable of wrenching Everton F.C. from Houlding’s control even if, after only a short time, he was able to establish a successful rival club.\\n\\nAnother feature of the schism was that it occurred within Protestant ranks for, despite the prominence often assigned to the role of sectarianism in Liverpool politics – and despite the political importance of Irish Home   \n",

In fact, other documentation I've seen suggests that, based on the ratio of signatures to \"\"x's\"\" in legal documents, it's possible that the NE colonies had something in the range of a 70-90% literacy rate, women included. (Spelling variants should not be read as examples of poor literacy, since standardized spelling was something that was only later observed, beginning in the late 18th/early 19th c., also.)108.20.74.63  \"   \n",

You may be well served by reviewing this administrator's noticeboard - SRA is not a topic of mainstream interest and the page should not place any emphasis on source and text that gives the impression that SRA is perceived as anything except a moral panic.

The first part of my edit is that which is taught in college (you would know if you ever attended). It is taught in literature class. It is: When studying this passage, or any passage of the Bible, it is best to use the Exegetical method, which is tearing it down to the bottom and rebuilding it using 6 contexts. First, one must use the Bible to interpret the Bible. Second, using the 6 contexts, which are: 1. What is the context (main idea, or thought) of the Bible?, 2. What is the context of the book you are reading (Genesis, Exodus, etc.)?, 3. What is the context of the chapter you are reading?, 4. What is the context of the verse you are reading? 5. What is the context of the key words?, and 6. What is the historical context? How did the people of that time think, act, etc. An example, to name something is to place one's authority on it. A king of a city state that has conquered another city state gives it a new name, because he is place his authority on it. Two things to keep in mind for a sound, correct interpretation of this passage are: 1. Where is the beginning of the narrative; the pivotal spot? It is Genesis 3:15, which is a prophecy of Christ and the beginning of the battle between evil and good. It is followed by the first example the story of Cain and Abel., 2. In the original Bible there were no chapter or verses, these were added later to make it easier to find passages. The story of the Flood begins at Genesis 4:17 and goes to Genesis 9:7 (this story should have been 1 chapter).\\nThis aids the scholar attempting to understand and interpret a difficult passage. \\nThe next part: Wilson's Old Testament Word Studies, William Wilson (MacDonald Publishing Co. ISBN 0-917006-27-5, New Wilson's Old Testament Word Studies, William Wilson; Kregel Publications 1987, ISBN 0-8254-4030-0/ both page 185)renders the word nephilim meaning as to fall upon other in rapine violence and apostates fallen from true religion. Strong's Exhaustive Concordance Of The Bible Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary, James Strong (MacDonald Publishing Co. ISBN 0-917006-01-1) cites the word as a bully,tyrant, or dictator. \\nHere is given references to where the data is gotten (even page numbers), but by what you say this is reliable or acceptable. Just what would be.\\nThe next part: One can get copies of the First and Second Book of Enoch, which one can read. Two such books are The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, Vol 1(Doubleday & Co. Inc., 1983 ISBN 0-385-09630-5)and The Other Bible(Harper & Row, Publishers ISBN 0-06-250031-7)and there others. A WARNING. When reading these books keep in mind that they are non-canonical and are considered fictional; not God inspired and truthful. When one reads the Book of Enoch one sees a measurement for the offspring as 300 cubits. A cubit is 18 inches (check any Bible dictionary), or 1 1/2 feet. As such the offspring is 450 feet tall.\\nThis again shows where one can find the data. All these references are from PUBLISHED and ESTABLISHED books, that is accepted by college professors, but not by you. How did the article get on Wikipedia? Did the author bribe someone, or is it that they are a dear buddy?\\nYou may think this harsh, and it may be, but it is deserved. The reason why the information has been verified with published authentic sources that you refuse to accept. Then what needs to take place is that the articles references must be rejected as well for they are based on the same method and material. Why accept one person's references and not an others when both are from published established sources available to the public.\\nOnce before I attempted this folly on an other article and again nothing, not even a police report, was accepted. The only thing I can think for this is that Wikipedia employees are not getting their palm greased, or that I am not a dear buddy with an in.\\nThe reliable verified referenced attainable data is beneficial and helpful to the reader and scholar, but you and Wikipedia don't care, and spit on me, my effort to help, and the ones who would have benefited from it. Now you cam laugh and do a dance for you wasted my time and you have robbed the reader.   \n",

I'm not looking for full edit-filter rights, but I would like to help develop the appropriate filter. If you don't have the time to deal with this right now let me know, and I'll engage someone else.\\n\\nI am new to the syntax, but here's my general format right now:\\n\\n(user_editcount < 50) & (article_namespace == 0) & (lcase(added_lines) rlike \"\"dateofbirth *=+|birth ?da(te|y)|\\(born |\\(b\\. \"\") & (lcase(added_lines) rlike \"\"\"\") & (lcase(removed_lines) rlike \"\"\"\")\\n\\nWhere I have  is the birthday searching regex I've been working on. Below is what I've developed so far. I haven't tested it extensively, but I've thrown it against a few BLPs and it works fairly well. It finds the usual ways that birthdays are presented, either in template, or in lead, for example (b.

I cannot figure out how to do it myself.\\n\\nAlso, someone should either reprogram or shut down this BOT.\\n\\nApril 2008\\n Welcome to Wikipedia. Although everyone is welcome to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, one or more of the external links you added  do not comply with our guidelines for external links and have been removed. Wikipedia is not a collection of links; nor should it be used for advertising or promotion. Since Wikipedia uses nofollow tags, external links do not alter search engine rankings. If you feel the link should be added to the article, please discuss it on the  before reinserting it. Please take a look at the welcome page to learn more about contributing to this encyclopedia. \\n\\nYour edit here was reverted by an automated bot that attempts to remove unwanted links and spam from Wikipedia. If you were trying to insert a good link, please accept my creator's apologies, but note that the external link you added or changed is on my list of links to remove and probably shouldn't be included in Wikipedia.\\n\\nThe external links I reverted were matching the following regex rule(s): rule: '[a-za-z][0-9]{2,}\\.photobucket\\.com/albums/.*\\.jpg' . If the external link you inserted or changed was to a media file (e.g. an image or a sound or video file) on an external server, then note that linking to such files may be subject to Wikipedia's copyright policy and therefore probably should not be linked to.  Please consider using our upload facility to upload a suitable media file.\\n\\nPlease read Wikipedia's external links guideline for more information, and consult my .

I'm hereby making my case that Larry was a Category 4 Cyclone (at very least) on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. Unlike some of you, I've taken the time to check out the FACTS for myself. If another one of you reverts my edits I will dissociate myself from WikiProject Tropical Cyclones indefinitely. \\nHere's my comparative table for all of you to have a nice, long look at ). If you ignore this reasoning, I'll just have to call you names:\\n\\n Characteristic Saffir-Simpson Cat 4 Cyclone Larry Central pressure 920-944 mbar 915! mbar when landfall made Potential damages \"\"More extensive curtainwall failures with some complete roof structure failure on small residences. Major erosion of beach areas. Terrain may be flooded well inland.\"\" 55% of all buildings in Innisfail damaged. Entire banana crop and some of sugarcane crop demolished. Rooves stripped of countless buildings; some buildings flattened entirely. Extensive flooding. Universal power outages, sewage system fails. Airports closed for the day. Storm surge4.0–5.5 m5.0m 1-minute average sustained winds210-245 kph Unknown, with gusts frequently exceeding 280kph. Conclusion Larry is indeed a category 4 cyclone at the very least.\\n\\nThank you,  \"   \n",

In the 1980-90's, a lot of True Aviation historians (i.e. Roger Freeman, Jeff Ethell, Warbirds Worldwide, etc..) found that aviation historians wanted and needed history recorded.  The captions of their books detailed who, what, when, where, etc...  As we progressed into the 2000's, I am finding that today’s writers unfortunately, want to dumb down the article - instead of giving all the details to allow the readers to decide how much level of detail he wants - Again, unfortunately, BillCJ (as well as others) want to take the Dick & Jane approach to aviation history.\\n\\nThis is suppose to be an online reference/encyclopedia - often when you Google an item, the wiki article is the first reference to pop-up so this will be (unfortunately) the first and only reference many will have for a subject.  A subject has to include everyone that references and item, whether it be a 4 year old doing his first model airplane, the aviation historian, the F-16 Buff.  These articles are also used by serious models who want the details.\\n\\nArticles only tell part of the story - you need the pictures to compliment and point out what the article is discussing.  In the same vein, the pictures need the same level of detailed study (if possible) and care that is place in creating the entire article.  Having a great and fantastic article (such as the F-16) with kindergarten captions makes the entire article pointless.\\n\\nIt is also unfortunate that other editors like Askari Mark feels that detailed captions are meaningless to most readers - again, you can not have an online reference/encyclopedia without filling crossing the t and doting the i's.  Without detailed captions, it like having no reference section - sure you can print captions that state \"\" Gee an F-16 in Flight \"\" - especially when it is clear that the airplane is sitting on the ground.  Or the case of one article \"\"Aircraft is on a bomb-run\"\" when it was clear from the picture that the bomb-bay doors were closed, no guns in the waist position and the detailed history showed the aircraft actually was a trainer and never left the United State...\\n\\nBillCJ also mentioned \"\" are you seriously suggesting that \"\" serious historians \"\" only read WP articles for the pictures? \"\" - it is a proven fact that 90% of all information processed by humans come from Visual\"\" data (i.e. pictures, etc...) - this is the reason Picture books are popular with preschoolers.  The first thing a majority humans look out when reading any thing is the pictures - if the pictures are interesting then many people will stop and read.  If an aviation historian comes across an article that details the subject matter then he will stop and read the contents.\\n\\nIt is also been said that this article is not for the F-16 Buffs - if this is the case, then \\n why have technical specifications\\n why have details on each variation??  \\n Why have the nuts and bolts of each individual user??\\n Etc, Etc, Etc...\\nWhy have detailed information regarding anything regarding the aircraft if this subject is not going to reach out to those who can say yes, this is true (i.e. the historian/buff) - If you are going to have the nuts and bolts in the article then you have to carry this same thought patterns over to have the nuts and bolts details in the photo captions.... (for example: B-52 Specifications, B-52 Costs, B-52 Variants) etc...  this type of informations IS for the Aviation Historian / Buff and generally not for the casual reader (which is MY point in having detailed captions).\\n\\nIf we dumbdown the photocaptions for the \"\"causual reader, then this level of details Specifications, costs, variations also needs to be removed as it will only confuse the \"\" casual reader \"\" and will lead to people calling all such information \"\" gobbledy-gook \"\".\\n\\nIf we dumbdown the photocaptions or call detailed information \"\" gobbledy-gook to most readers \"\" then terms such as: Wing area, Airfoil, Zero-lift drag coefficient, Drag area, Aspect ratio, Maximum speed:, Combat radius:, Ferry range, Service ceiling ,Rate of climb, Wing loading, Thrust/weight, Lift-to-drag ratio are \"\"gobbledy-gook to most non-aviation readers\"\"\\n\\nBillCJ has also mentioned that Wiki is not the place for F-16 Buff's to write article - This is complete opposite what the founders of wiki wanted when this project (wikipedia as a whole) dreamed many, many years ago - Wiki w   \n",

Good examples are (for subjects area): Lists_of_philosophers or Deaths_in_2007 Also very good example (not being a subject) is List_of_mathematics_articles_(0-9). If you would say everything and anything could be a stand-alond list, what would the different from a normal list? I think the guideline are not well defined.   \n",

I was aware of the term ('Golodomor' in Russian transliteration) as the \"\"the great famine of early 1930s throughout the Soviet Union, predominantly in the Ukraine, but also in Southern Russia, due to the policies of the collectivisation and de-kulakization.\"\" There was no connection or comparisons to Holocaust in my mind, in part because the term Holocaust was not in use in the general discourse. It was as if WWII happened but Holocaust did not. That was really weird. \\n\\nNow, the term Holocaust in Russian is much more common. However, the two words look differently in Russian - Gogolomor and Holokost; so that's why (with my background) is hard to see a connection, although I'm more aware now of how it became a political rather than just a historic term. \\n\\nHope this clarifies my perspective.

They meant they would wield a strong federal government to promote equality.\"\"This is known as socialism.\\n\\nI'm a patriotic citizen, myself. I don't care much for left or right wing regimes. (The dictators, F.D.R. or George Dubya Bush)\\n\\nIf Jefferson or Tom Paine could see the insanity that goes on their names, by both the left and right wings of this country, they would be rolling in their graves.

It is the largest sect in Pakistan. Even the outdated CIA fact book can verify this. It seems that alJazera does not know what they are talking about. If anyone have a doubt about the connection between Barelvis and sufis, then simply read an article about Barelvis(which is insufficient and at parts incorrect - like many other articles here). They are sufis or they have a sufi master to whom they belong(speaking on the individual level). Personally I can tell you that for a Barelvi, sufis are considered our elderly; our wise sages who we seek for enlightenment and religious knowledge. Barelvi == Sufi more or less(to simplify things for the reader). People need to stop selling their propaganda and belittling the sufis. Barelvis usually call themselves ahle sunnah wal'jamat(this would be the international representative name barelvis refer themselves as - unlike in Pakistan and India due to complexities arising due to impostors). This is the largest sect in the Islamic world(no quotation - simply based on experience and personal research); where sufis are considered as mentioned, our elderly, our sages, our spiritual guides. Hence sufi's are not some sect, but simply our respectable elderly. The sect is called Ahle Sunnah wal'Jamat. An ok translation would be \"\"The people of the Sunnah\"\". Unlike Christianity, the right to claim of the true sect is of utmost importance for muslims due to Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad s.a.w mentioning of the divide among us and that only one sect would be the truly guided one - which shall happen to be the largest one(from the hadith). Again seek out the source if you are interested. Its in the major Hadith collections. Hence quantity is an important question when it comes to pinpointing any discrepancy in this regard. Strictly speaking from an encyclopedic perspective, how can it be considered acceptable to disregard quantity ? If anyone doubts that most Pakistanis are sufis/barelvis/ahle sunnat wal'jamat. Then simply take a look at Sindh. I don't have the exact number, but its like 90-95 % sufis. Its only in NWFP that the majority are Wahabis. But that corresponds to ca. less than 10%(there are shia as well in NWFP and some other sects) of the total population in Pakistan(census 2010). How difficult is it for people to at least conduct their own research and try to separate truth from fallacy ?\"   \n",

I am on a Hughes Sat network that uses transparent proxies.  This was causing me to log in and out from page to page.  The original article which was not the correct article went through and posted when I switched to SSL wiki server.  This was unexpected, and as I was editing the article to the correct format it was deleted. (roughly 60-90 seconds from the originally post)   Due to this technical error the correct post was never entered into wiki.\\n\\nThis would have been the correct post if the article had not been deleting during editing and if I had not had technical issues which inadvertly caused me to post the incorrect format of the article.\\n\\nThe Clifton Steamboat Museum\\nThe Clifton Steamboat Museum is located at 8727 Fannett Rd, Beaumont, Texas.

If this is correct, can you please tell me if this article would be acceptable.  I plan on adding bio's for all the museums artist's, so please let me know where, if any, I am not in compliance with wiki.\\n\\nSincerly\\n \"   \n",

       "159565    The numbers in parentheses are the additional decimal points which have been measured but lie outside the accuracy of the measurement process. This means the values in the parentheses eg (15) could be used for the purpose of calculation, but any value that results from such a calculation would not be more accurate than the number of significant figures if those in parentheses were not considered. In other words, the values in parentheses are there to help avoid rounding errors if you’re trying to work to the limit of accuracy of the gas constant. I agree that this is not commonly known, and only confuses the issue. I would recommend removing it.\n",
